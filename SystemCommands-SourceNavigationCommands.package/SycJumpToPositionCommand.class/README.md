I am an Abstract command for jumping to useful positions in code, either forward or backward (the direction is overriden by specific sub commands). 

This is particularly useful after code completing a mult-paramemter keyword selector, and wanting to jump to the next keyword to fill in a value. It is also useful for jumping to a block variable etc.

What can make these commands tricky is the present of comments in source, as well as broken source that is still being entered (and thus wanting to jump forward to continue editting it to make it compile).
